# Arkhn DevOps exercise

## Introduction

If you're there it means you've succesfully passed the first interview, congratulations :)

**It is now time to demonstrate your amazing skills !**

Don't worry if you don't already know all the tools we will be using through this exercise: reading documentation and learning is a part of it !
Depending on your knowledge of the several tools, this exercise may take about 1-4 hours.

There will be 4 steps, and the two last ones are optional: we don't expect you to finish all steps if you're completely unfamiliar with some concepts.
You will have to create a git repository (on github.com or somewhere else) with your work and a small documentation (a README.md like this one is enough) to explain how to use it.

## STEP 1: A small python program

## STEP 2: Dockerizing the program

The goal of this step is to right a Dockerfile in order to containerize the python applications. The result is a docker image which can be used using `docker run <your_image>`.
The python program must behave the same way than when running it locally.

## STEP 3: Using a CI to build a publish your docker image

## STEP 4: Ansible automation
